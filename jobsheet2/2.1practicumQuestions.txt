Q.4 Pay attention to  the method updateIpk contained in  the Mahasiswa class. Modify the 
content of the method so that the GPA entered is valid, namely first checking whether the 
GPA entered is in the range of 0.0 to 4.0 (0.0 <= GPA <= 4.0). If the GPA is not in that range, 
the message is issued: "GPA is invalid. Must be between 0.0 and 4.0".

        if (gpa < 0 || gpa >4){
            return "invalid ";
        }
        else if(gpa >= 3.5){
            return "Excellent";

Q.5 Explain how  the nilaiKinerja() method  works in evaluating student performance, what 
criteria are used to determine the performance value, and what is returned by the 
nilaiKinerja()  method? 

Answer : rhis method work on if statement which state that if the gpa is greater then 3.5 return value which is string "excellent"
        and voice versa else return "poor" when the gpa is less then 2.5 then re turn value "poor" so it work on the camparing values 
        of gpa with the value which we assigned. 

         if(gpa >= 3.5){
            return "Excellent";
        }
        else if( gpa >=3.0){
            return "Good";
        }
        else if (gpa >= 2.5){
            return "Avrage";
        }
