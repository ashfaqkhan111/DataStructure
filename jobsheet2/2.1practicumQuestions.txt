Quesions Practicum 2.1

Q.1 Name two characteristics of a class or object!

Answer: the characteristics of class and object is attributes and methods.



Q.2 Pay attention to the Mahasiswa class in Practicum 1, how many attributes do the Student class 
have? Mention what the attributes are! 

Answer:the class Student has 4 attributes  1, nim 2, name 3, studentClass 4, Gpa.


Q.3 How many methods does the class have? Mention what the methods are!

Answer : the class Student has 4 method and 1 main mathod to execute the methodes in side class Students 
            method 1  displayInformation();
                   2 changeClass();
                   3 changeGpa();
                   4 performanceGrade();



Q.4 Pay attention to  the method updateIpk contained in  the Mahasiswa class. Modify the 
content of the method so that the GPA entered is valid, namely first checking whether the 
GPA entered is in the range of 0.0 to 4.0 (0.0 <= GPA <= 4.0). If the GPA is not in that range, 
the message is issued: "GPA is invalid. Must be between 0.0 and 4.0".

Answer: this easy and possible using  if statement 

            
        if (gpa < 0 || gpa >4){
            return "invalid ";
        }
        else if(gpa >= 3.5){
            return "Excellent";
        }
        else if( gpa >=3.0){
            return "Good";
        }
        else if (gpa >= 2.5){
            return "Avrage";
        }
        else {
             return "poor";
        
    }

Q.5 Explain how  the nilaiKinerja() method  works in evaluating student performance, what 
criteria are used to determine the performance value, and what is returned by the 
nilaiKinerja()  method? 

Answer : rhis method work on if statement which state that if the gpa is greater then 3.5 return value which is string "excellent"
        and voice versa else return "poor" when the gpa is less then 2.5 then re turn value "poor" so it work on the camparing values 
        of gpa with the value which we assigned. 

         if(gpa >= 3.5){
            return "Excellent";
        }
        else if( gpa >=3.0){
            return "Good";
        }
        else if (gpa >= 2.5){
            return "Avrage";
        }
        else 
            return "poor";
        


2.2.3 Questions 
 
Q1. In the StudentMain class, indicate the line of program code used for the instance process!
Amswer: instance mean object so this line is instance Student st1 = new Student (); 

Q2. How do I access the attributes and methods of an object? 
Answer : 
        to acces attributes first write object then dotand then  attribute name and assignment oprater 
        like st1.name="khan";
        for method it is same object name then dot then method ();
        like st1.updategpa(3.4);

q.4 What are the output output results of  the method tampilkanInformasi() first and second 
    different? 
Answer: 
        first this function will print the values which we assign at the begining 
        but later the updategpa(); and updateclass(); it will print the new values.  





2.3.3 Questions 
   
Q1. In  the Mahasiswa class  in practicum 3, indicate the program code line used to declare a 
    parameterized constructor!

    this line in class student is constructor with parameters 

    public Student(String name, String nim, String studentClass, double gpa){
        this.name= name;
        this.nim = nim;
        this.studentClass = studentClass;
        this.gpa = gpa; }

Q2. Pay attention to the StudentMain class. What exactly does the following line of program do? 
    Student st2 = new Student("ashfaq khan","254107020262", "T4" , 2.5)
Answer: 

        this line create new veriable st2 and then call the parameter constructor pass the values and 
        save it in st2 veriable.



Q3. Remove the default constructor on  the Mahasiswa class, and then compile and run the 
    program. How did it turn out? Explain why this is the case! 

Answer: if i remove the default constructor    public Student (){}     the program will show errors 
        beacuse some time java create constructor by it self but whn i create my own constructor
        manually java thinks the programmer is maniging it manually so when i remove this line    public Student (){}
        in the main class we have this constructor  Student st1 = new Student(); so the default constructor will ot find 
        matching thats why it turn out.

Q3. After instantiating the object, do the methods in the Mahasiswa class  have to be accessed 
sequentially? Explain why!

Answer: no you can call them in any order even multiple times.
